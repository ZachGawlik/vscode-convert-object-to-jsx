## Publishing

(a.k.a. note to self)

This library only gets published to VSCode marketplace and not npm.
Publishing is done manually locally.
There is no need to manually increment the "version" field in `package.json`.
See [VSCode's publishing documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#autoincrementing-the-extension-version)
